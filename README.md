### Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rainer and I am a Developer in Calgary, Alberta. I have a passion for creative coding. I've mainly been coding with React (JAMstack) 
but the stack I learned in school is V-LAMP. I am also a music producer and audio engineer outside of coding. The feeling you get when you finish 
producing a song is a feeling of completion, satisfaction and joy. This is the same feeling I get when I complete a coding project, being able to 
take parts of code, put them together and see everthing work is a wonderful feeling.

Things I do with my spare time include producing electronic music, mastering music, creative coding, camping, and fishing.
