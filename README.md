### Hey There! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rainer and I am a Junior Full Stack Developer in Calgary, Alberta. I have a passion for creative coding and my main stack 
is V-LAMP. Most recently, I also have experience with JAMstack. I am also a music producer and audio engineer outside of coding. The feeling
you get when you finish producing a song is a feeling of completion, satisfaction and joy. This is the same feeling I get when I complete
a coding project, being able to take parts of code, put them together and see everthing work is a wonderful feeling.

Things I do with my spare time include producing music, mastering music, camping, fishing, and playing old school retro 2d games.

- ðŸ”­  Iâ€™m currently working on: I am currently coding a techno music sequencer in the web browser with p5.js/JavaScript. 
The hope is to be able to turn this into a full Digital Audio Workstation in the end. I have a long way to go but the initial (and basic) processes
are in place. 

- ðŸ’»  I have experience with: HTML5, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Vue.js, React, p5.js, Python, SQL, MariaDB, Google Cloud Technology, Git, Contentful, Asana and Figma.
