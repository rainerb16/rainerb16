### Hello World! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Rainer and I am a Full Stack Development Student in Calgary, Canada. I'm currently
enrolled in a Full Stack Development Diploma program, graduating in December of 2020. I am a driven, passionate, 
and curious learner with a willingness to learn. I'm looking forward to entering the tech industry and seeking an 
internship or junior role towards the end of my studies.

Things I do with my spare time include camping, fishing, and I have a passion for producing & mixing/mastering 
electronic music. I also currently co-own a digital record label that is focused on QBIPOC.
